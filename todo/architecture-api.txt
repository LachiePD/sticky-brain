ARCHITECTURE AND API

Refactor backend to return deck data directly instead of data.response.rows.

Add username data validation checks inside AuthServices.fetchUser.

Move areCredentialsValid utility from the factory into the AuthService.

Implement backend service-level error handling for duplicate deck names.


there needs to be a middleware to handle assertData() for the controllers. It will be used by all of them , will stop the need for repeating the import and use of  assertData() function

need to create a helper function in the  Service layer to check for valid response. 

have a look at useDeckList hook , theres a lot happening there, probably time for deckList to become a context. Thats the easier answer, I dont love it
