in Editor.jsx, then state [front, setFront] , [back, setBack] should really be one state called cardData = {front:"", back:""}


in Deck.jsx, the <Editor/> component has a handleNewFlash card. This is a sign that deckList should be in a context, as no other deckMode needs this? actually, practice will want to edit cards, so handleNewFlash card should maybe be made dumber? I'm not sure. All signs point to deckList in context


In <Deck/> , the <Inspect/> component should probably be just what the component renders by default
